# SQLite Database Implementation

## Overview
The payroll application now uses SQLite database for data persistence, solving the issue where all data was lost on page reload.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Data Persistence
- All employee and payslip data is stored in SQLite database
- Data persists across browser sessions and page refreshes
- Database is automatically saved to localStorage

### ✅ Database Structure
- **Employees Table**: Stores all employee information (7 default employees included)
- **Payslips Table**: Stores all payslip records with calculations
- **Automatic Schema**: Tables are created automatically on first run

### ✅ Functionality
- Create payslips with database storage
- View historical payslip data
- Generate comprehensive wage bill reports
- Query payslips by period, department, designation
- Delete payslips with database updates

## How It Works

1. **First Load**: SQLite database is created and populated with default employees
2. **Payslip Creation**: All payroll calculations are saved to the database
3. **Data Retrieval**: Dashboard and reports query live data from database
4. **Persistence**: Database state is automatically saved to localStorage
5. **Page Refresh**: All data is preserved and loaded from localStorage

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: View summary statistics from database
2. **Add Payslip**: Select employee and create payslip (saved to database)
3. **Reports**: Access comprehensive analytics generated from database queries
4. **Data Persistence**: All data survives page refreshes and browser restarts

## Technical Details

- **Technology**: sql.js (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for persistence
- **Schema**: Relational database with foreign key relationships
- **Queries**: Full SQL query support for reporting and analytics

## Benefits

✅ **No More Data Loss**: All payroll data persists between sessions
✅ **Historical Records**: Query previous payslips and reports
✅ **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive wage bill reporting
✅ **Scalable Storage**: SQLite database can handle large datasets
✅ **Offline Capability**: Works entirely in the browser without server
